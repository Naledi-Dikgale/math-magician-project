      My name is Naledi, meaning star in the Southern Sotho language.
      People tell me that I am talkative and have a certain glow and purity that
      reminds them of the stars in the night sky. I strive to live up to this
      compliment every day.While I believe that beauty comes from within and is not just about
      physical appearance, I try to take care of myself and present myself
      in a way that reflects my inner beauty. I feel blessed to have an inner
      strength that allows me to face challenges with grace and
      determination.

    <p className="welcome-text">
      As for the comparison to a work of art or shining light, I humbly
      acknowledge that I am but a small part of the larger universe.
      However, I do believe that we all have the potential to shine bright
      and make a positive impact in the world. And if my name and its meaning
      can inspire others to see the beauty in themselves and others, then
      I am proud to be called Naledi, the golden star that brings hope to
      others in times of despair.
